            <h1>Everything you need to know to play TARGET PRACTICE</h1>
             <h2>Overall Goal</h2>
             <p>Your task is to click on as many yellow and purple targets as you can before the time runs out</p>
             <h2>Target Info</h2>
             <p>Yellow circle: for the first ten seconds remains motionless, then afterwards begins to move and at certain increments will get faster until 10 seconds left where max speed is applied. <br>Purple Circle: Remains motionless until clicked, which causes two yellow circles to appear in its place!</p>
             <h2>BONUS TIME</h2>
             <p>Each game you are given three time extension circles found on the bottom left. Clicking one causes the time to be reset to 60 seconds and stops all current motion of the circles for ten seconds, where they will begin moving once more. Use these wisely and you can rack up some serious scores!</p>
             <h2>WHERE'S THE MUSIC?</h2>
             <p>To be sure that everyone is happy with the music, I have added the feature of making it playable and pausable at the users discretion, should they not prefer the music, it can be left off. : )</p>
