    <h1>Portfolio Goal:</h1>
    <p>The goal of my portfolio is simply to inform those interested of what I have done, both now and in the future. It will serve as a website for an audience of potential employers mainly, and a secondary audience would be anyone curious about my works. Organization of content as of now will be chronological from top to bottom of what I have done, meaning my earliest works will be first in the content section, and my most recent works will be near the bottom. Below are the mobile and desktop design sketches.</p>
    <img src="media/designsketchup (1).jpg" alt="Mobile design sketch" width="500px" height="500px">
    <img src="media/designsketchup (2).jpg" alt="Desktop design sketch"width="500px" height="500px">

    <p>The dimensions of the images will need to be at least 516 x 516 so they can be scaled appropriately on the webpage. As of right now the only resources that are on the website that are not of my ownership are the placeholder images, which are linked to their rightful owners website, or alternatively <a href="https://placeholder.com/">you can click here</a> and you'll be taken to their website.</p>
