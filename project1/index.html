                <h2>About me!</h2>
                <p>I'm a Game Design and Development Major from Honeoye Falls New York! Back before I even hit elementary I was handed my first ever video game and console; The GameBoy™ and a copy of Pokemon™ Red. Ever since that day my life opened up to a world of games that was growing and expanding every day. The games that came out and the systems that supported them fascinated me to seemingly no end, and I deeply wanted to know how they were made, so I joined a coding club in 8th grade, which sent me down a path of exploring and creating with code. My passions lie in games, both playing and creating them, and I aim to one day be part of a company that creates some of the games that I love! When I'm not busy doing homework you can usually find me hanging out with friends and famliy!</p>

                    <p><a href="https://people.rit.edu/lga7192/235/randomphrases/random-phrases.html">Random Phrases</a> is a small homage to the late author J.R.R Tolkein, which will display some of my favorite quotes from the man who gave so much to the lives of many. This was produced using a mix of HTML, CSS, and mostly Javascript to produce what is seen. This was a self-made project and one of my first forays into JavaScript, so it was indeed a decent challenge to make, but nothing too major. If anything the hardest challenge was setting up the random exchange betwen each quote correctly but this was overcome too. In the end I had given myself a great challenge in Javascript and a bolstering to my knowledge in it.</p>

                <p><a href="https://people.rit.edu/lga7192/235/Project3/game.html">Target Practice</a> is an accuracy trainer in a small yet enjoyable format. The overall goal is to get the highest score possible in the time alloted. You do so by clicking on the circles as they appear in each level; Yellow targets move faster over time while Purple targets split into two and remains motionless until destroyed. To make this game, I used Visual Studio Code 2019 and the coding languages HTML, CSS, Javascript and PIXIJS. This project was self-made and provided many challenges along the way. My greatest triumph was overcomming the issues with the timer, to which was having a problem with timing out correctly. I was able to effectively provide a solution to the problem, and even manipulate the time further to create a time extension feature as a power-up to the player while still timing out correctly. My overall goal was to make a game anyone could play to help improve the accuracy of their mouse clicks, which is a good skill to have when playing games that require rapid movements to face a certain direction or click on something using your mouse. I am very happy to see what I was able to do and I can assuredly say that I achieved my goal.</p></div>
