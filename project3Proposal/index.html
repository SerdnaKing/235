    <h1>Project 3 Proposal</h1>
    <h2>By: Liam Andres</h2>
    <h2>Name of the game: Target Practice</h2>
    <!-- keep the commented section as a less condesnsed version of the game's concept -->
    <!-- <p id="description">THE GAME HAS BALLS ALL AROUND THE SCREEN THAT ARE RANDOMLY PLACED, THE GOAL IS TO CLICK EACH OF THEM. CLICKING THEM CAUSES THEM TO DISAPPEAR, AFTER A CERTAIN LEVEL, THE TASK GETS HARDER AND HARDER, THERE'S A TIMER THAT IS RESET AT EACH LEVEL AND CLICKING THE CIRCLES BECOMES A LESS SIMPLE TASK, THE BALLS CAN MOVE AROUND , CHANGE SIZES THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL OR NOT TO THE PLATER, ETC. MISSING A CIRCLE WILL CAUSE A PENALTY TO THE PLAYER'S REMAINING TIME. THE GAME WILL BE OVER ONCE THE PLAYER RUNS OUT OF TIME. THERE IS NO END TO THE GAME, ONLY HOW HIGH THE PLAYER CAN SCORE</p> -->
    <div class="description"><p> GAME CONCEPT: The game is a simplistic but challenging one; the goal is to click on the circles that appear in the game field each successful click rewarding a point to the player. This will be a task that grows more challenging as you progress by means of a timer, the targets moving after a certain point, and a steadily increasing number of circles. The goal is to get as many points as possible by the end of the run, that being when the player runs out of time.</p>
    <p>GENRE: Arcade style game</p>
    <p>PLATFORM: Desktop only (requires a mouse)</p>
    <p>STORY: This game is purely abstract</p>
    <p>AESTHETICS: Aiming for a simple geometric/pixelated point and click game with small chipper sound effects and simple but pleasing visuals</p>

    <p>ABOUT THE DEV: I am a second year Game Design and Development student at RIT, also seeking a minor in Digital Literature and Comparative Media. My skillsets are developing as we speak and include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and a number of Editing platforms like Photoshop. Interests of mine include Dungeons and Dragons, where I run a home made game with my closest friends (This game really brings out my most creative side).</p>
