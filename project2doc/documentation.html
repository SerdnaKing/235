    <h2>My goal with this project</h2>
    <p> The goal I had set out to achieve was to make a website where you could search for a specific anime using the Unofficial Jikan API. The target audience includes anyone interested in anime. I would like to include a search system that returns an image of the anime along with some information like the anime's overview, rating, score, and episode count</p>

    <p>To meet the requirements of the project, I will implement a search button with a text input from the user, a limiting dropdown menu to select how many results to display and a favorites list that can be added to and have current favorites removed by the click of a button</p>

    <p>Update: the only problem I have faced with implementation has been the favorites area. The menu was difficult to set up so that it would respond from clicking an add to favorites button but have it be a part of each returned value from the API. A solution was found but consumed 4 days of bug testing to fix.</p>

    <p>Below are the sources of all the outside material that I pulled in to use in my project</p>

    <h2>Grading myself:</h2>
    <p> If I had to give myself a grade I would say I earned in the low to mid 80's range. There are places that could be better and things that aren't the best, like the favorites being reset on each refreshing of the page, but I made a solid effort to make the website visually pleasing and functional at all sizes at and above 1024x756 as specified by Professor Wheeland in the Project 2 Details video on MyCourses</p>
